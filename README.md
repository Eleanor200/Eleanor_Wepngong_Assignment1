# Question 1 
1. User must first enter the number upto which he/she wants to find the sum and is stored in the variable num.
2. Using for loop take the elements one by one from 1 to num.
3. Use if,else statement for each element to find whether it is odd or even by dividing the element by 2.
4. Initialize the variables odd_sum and even_sum to zero, sum difference, 1/3 of even_sum, and 1/5 of odd_sum.
5. If the element is even,then increment the variable even_sum with the current element.
6. If the element is odd,then increment the variable odd_sum with the current element.
7. Then using basic operation "-", and "*" to find the sum difference and others
9. Print the variables odd_sum, even_sum separately, sum difference, 1/3 even_sum and 1/5 odd_sum and exit.

# Question 2
1. Take an integer as a input and store it in the variable num.
2. Initialize the variable sum to zero.
3. Divide the input integer by 10 and obtain its remainder & quotient.
4. Store the remainder in the variable rem.
5. Increment the variable sum with variable rem.
6. Store the quotient into the variable num.
7. Repeats the process until the number is not 0.
8. Print the variable sum as output and exit.

# Question 4
1. Generate a random number between 0 and 100.
2. Then iterate from 1 to 100 and check if the input number is equal to the assumed number or not.
3. If yes, then the player wins the game.
4. Otherwise, terminate the game after 10 attempts using an if or else condition

# Question 5
1. Declare a String variable as character array char str[100];
2. Declare and initialize an integer variables as int i, upper=0,lower=0,Special=0;
3. The user asked to enter a string to count upper case, lower case, Special characters
4. The given string is stored in the variable str;
5. A for-loop is used to count total characters of the given string.
6. It is initialized as i=0, checks the test-expression whether str[i] != ‘\0’; and executes the loop until the given condition becomes true
7. Use an if condition to test if(str[i]>=’A’ && str[i]<=’Z’), if it is true,  The upper becomes upper + 1(upper=upper+1);
8. When it is false, control moves to the else-if part and evaluates the test-expression of else-if. if it is true The lower becomes lower + 1(lower=lower+1);
9. When it is false, control moves to the else part and executes the else part statements. the special becomes special+1
10. Finally, the program displays the total number of the upper case, lower case, Special characters of the given string
